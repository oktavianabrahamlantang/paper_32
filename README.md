# Convolutional Neural Network For Predicting The Spread of Cancer

We are developing a Convolutional Neural Network for predicting the spread of Cancer. Before using the code you need to download the data set and some necessary file directly from this link:

You also can read the details of our work in the pdf file : https://github.com/oktavianabrahamlantang/paper_32/blob/master/predict_cancer_finalversion.pdf

This code based on our work that submitted to Coginfocom Conference 2019 "Convolutional Neural Network For Predicting The Spread of Cancer"
